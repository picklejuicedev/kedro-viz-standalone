# Kedro-Viz Standalone Component

A tweaked version of the standalone app from [tynandebold](https://github.com/tynandebold/kedro-viz-standalone) app that can run [Kedro-Viz](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-viz) as a standalone component on a static website.

It loads a local `pipeline.json` file and renders it.

## Install and run

```bash
npm install && npm start
```

## build

```bash
npm run build
```

You can now use the output in the build folder to embed into your static website.
